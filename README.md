We use the ubCSPtraining file for both training and testing, with results printed in the bottom. 
It runs on trainedmodels in the trainedmodeldata file located in results

All the iterations of different hyperparameters of our models are saved in the Results file. 
They can be loaded in the within_data file to analyse performance on each model.
